Welcome to Moe!

Moe is our resident Music-Organizer-Extraordinaire who's sole purpose is to give you full control over your music library. Essentially, Moe can help streamline and automate the process between downloading/ripping music to your filesystem and listening to it with your favorite music player.

In short, Moe maintains a database of your music library that can be updated with various metadata sources, queried, edited, etc through either an API or command-line interface. All of these features, and more, are made available by a rich plugin ecosystem. The best way to learn more about what Moe can do for you is to poke around the various :doc:`plugins <plugins/plugins>` and to try it out.

If you want to learn more, check out the `Getting Started <https://mrmoe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_ docs.
