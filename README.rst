Welcome to Moe!
===============

Moe is our resident Music-Organizer-Extraordinaire who's sole purpose is to give you full control over your music library. In other words, it's a commandline-interface for managing your music akin to `beets <https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_.

Development Warning
-------------------
Moe is in *very* early stage development, and is still training for his goal to become your all-powerful music library assistant. You are more than welcome to poke around the codebase or `strike up a conversation <https://github.com/jtpavlock/moe/discussions>`_ about design ideas, or anything else really. If you do find any bugs though, I'd definitely appreciate you opening up a `ticket <https://github.com/jtpavlock/moe/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug-report.md>`_.

So what can Moe do right now?
-----------------------------
* Add music to your library.

  * Also copies the music to a set library path and organizes it by artist/album.
* Remove music from your library.
* List any music in your library.
* Print out tags of your music.

Like I said, *very* early in development. If you're still here and want to test out Moe in his current state, check out the `Getting Started <https://mrmoe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_ documentation.
