Welcome to Moe!

Moe is our resident Music-Organizer-Extraordinaire who's sole purpose is to give you full control over your music library. In other words, it's a commandline-interface for managing your music.

Development Warning
*******************
Moe is currently in early development, and is still training for his goal to become your all-powerful music library assistant. You are more than welcome to start using Moe, but don't be surprised if you find any bugs or a lack of features. If you do find any bugs, or would like to request a feature, I'd appreciate you `opening an issue <https://github.com/jtpavlock/Moe/issues/new/choose>`_.

So what can Moe do right now?
=============================
* Add music to your library, fixing tags with metadata from Musicbrainz.
* Organize, remove, list, and edit your music in the library.
* Supports including extra files with an album e.g. log or playlist files.
* Supports tags that can contain multiple values.
