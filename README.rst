Development Warning
*******************
Moe is currently in early development, and is still training for his goal to become your all-powerful music library assistant. You are more than welcome to start using Moe, but don't be surprised if you find any bugs or a lack of features. If you do find any bugs, or would like to request a feature, please feel free to `open an issue <https://github.com/MoeMusic/Moe/issues/new/choose>`_.

So what can Moe do right now?
=============================
* Add music to your library, fixing tags with metadata from Musicbrainz.
* Organize, remove, list, and edit your music in the library.
* Supports including extra files with an album e.g. log or playlist files.
* Supports tags with multiple values.
