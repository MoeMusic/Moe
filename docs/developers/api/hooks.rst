Hooks
#####

Moe uses `pluggy hooks <https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ in order to create a plugin interface. If you're creating a plugin, you should be using these hooks to implement your plugin functionality. Hooks are easy to make and extremely flexible, so if there's a part of Moe you'd like to change and don't see a suitable hook, please feel free to reach out!
